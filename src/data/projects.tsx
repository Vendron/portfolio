        description: "Helio is a game-focused Discord bot designed to integrate with popular game APIs, providing real-time multiplayer matchmaking and engaging player-driven markets. The game uses Machine Learning to optimise player engagement, creating a dynamic and interactive experience.\n## Key Features\n\n#### Player-Driven Markets\n- Machine learning models analyse player behavior to adjust in-game economies, item prices and drop-rates.\n#### Image Generation\n- New items, pets, cosmetics, and monsters are procedurally generated using AI-based image creation tools.\n#### Procedural Dungeon Generation\n- Infinite, re-playable dungeons are generated for players, ensuring a fresh experience each time.\n\n## My Role\nI created of the Helio bot, and later expanded the team to include additional developers, rebasing the entire project. My contributions included:\n\n- Designing the game and creating the in-game artwork.\n- Conducting A/B testing and playtests to analyze player interactions.\n- Implementing features based on the most used and enjoyed aspects of the game.\n- Organizing SCRUM meetings and writing hundreds of user stories to guide development.\n- Managing a global team of 11 developers.\n\nHelio is built with **TypeScript** and uses advanced technologies to deliver a unique gaming experience on Discord.",        startDate: "2022-08-23",

Features include pre-built models for age prediction and customizable data processing pipelines.\n\nI added functions for Deep Learning models to handle the longitudinal data, keeping the temporal vector for RNNs and CNNs with their inputs having the same shape. I also added a function to handle the data in a way that the user can choose the time window for the data to be processed, and the function will return the data in the format that the user wants.",
